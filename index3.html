<h1>Asia</h1>
<h2> As the largest and most populous continent in the world with just over 3.8 billion people, Asia is composed of a wide variety of ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties, and governmental systems. 

<h3>Geographically the continent makes up 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area, and 29.5% of its land area. 

In the west, Asia is bordered by Europe, the eastern coastline of the Mediterranean Sea, as well by the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus Strait, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. 

In the east, Asia is bordered by the Pacific Ocean, and an almost endless stretch of bays and seas. 

The Arctic Ocean and a handful of seas front the northern border, while the Bering Sea separates Asia from North America. In the southwest the Red Sea and isthmus of Suez separate the continent from Africa. 

The Indian Ocean fronts most of Asia's southern borders, along with a series of bays, gulfs and seas, as well as extensive chains of both inhabited and uninhabited islands. 
China, Japan, Korea, and India are thought of the most when referring to Asia. These countries are rich in spices, culture, and beautiful landmarks. The religions in thess countries are amazing. For example India's main religion is Hinduism. Hinduism is the oldest current religion right now. It is an extremely complex polytheistic religion. Many religions in Asia come off of this religion. Like Buddhism.
